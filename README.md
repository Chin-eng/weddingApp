# a wedding RSVP app

This is the final homework for CSE 331 Spring 2024, which keeps track of guests coming to James and Molly's wedding. The app has the following logic:

- Users must be able to view the list of all guests that have been added so far. Each guest's name must be listed along with an indication of whether they are a guest of James or Molly and 
  if they are bringing at most 1 additional guest if known.
  
- Along with the list of individual guests, there should be a summary of the number of guests of Molly and James that have been added to the list and, for each, the number of those 
  invited guests who are family.
  
- James and Molly must be able to add guests and specify their names, whether they are guests of either James or Molly and if they are family. If they decide not to add the guest, they 
  should be able to go “back” to the guest list page and the guest will not be added.
  
- Once a guest has been added, they must be able to set additional details about themselves and their additional guest, if they’re bringing one. Clicking on the names of guests in the   
  Guest List should open a page with fields to enter their dietary restrictions and if they’re getting an additional guest.
  
- The guest’s dietary restrictions and the name and dietary restrictions of their additional guest (if they are bringing 1 additional guest) must be specified in order for the guest 
  details to be updated, otherwise an error message should appear indicating what’s missing
